About Crocodile Technology 1.51
-------------------------------

Crocodile Technology 1.51 is the latest release of Crocodile Technology. It has been released because 
it was found that some combinations of printer/printer driver were producing badly formatted printouts.
We have also taken this opportunity to make other improvements, as suggested by current users of the 
software.
